# Flex Web Online Compiler - Updates

## New Features and Improvements

### 1. Input Handling for `da5l()` Function

A major enhancement has been added to the Flex Online Compiler to support programs that use the `da5l()` function for user input. This functionality enables:

- Real-time input handling during program execution
- Ability to queue multiple inputs in advance
- Visual indication when a program is waiting for input
- WebSocket-based communication for efficient input/output

### 2. Shortcuts Panel Redesign

The keyboard shortcuts display has been redesigned from a modal dialog to an inline panel that:

- Stays within the same window context
- Has a clean white background
- Provides a more integrated user experience
- Appears/disappears smoothly with animations

## Implementation Notes

### Input Handling Implementation

The input handling system uses a dual-approach with WebSockets as the primary method and AJAX as a fallback:

1. **Frontend**: 
   - Added an input area below the output panel
   - Implemented an input queue system for pre-loading inputs
   - Created status indicators for when the program is waiting for input
   - Added WebSocket connection for real-time communication

2. **Backend**:
   - Added WebSocket server for real-time communication
   - Implemented execution tracking with unique IDs
   - Created input handling middleware for the Flex interpreter
   - Added ability to send/receive inputs during execution

3. **Flex Interpreter Modification**:
   - The Flex interpreter needs a small patch to send a special token when requesting input
   - The patch adds a line to print `__FLEX_INPUT_REQUEST__` before calling `input()`
   - This token triggers the frontend to prompt the user for input

### Dependencies Added

The following dependencies were added to support these features:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "uuid": "^9.0.1",
    "ws": "^8.16.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.0.3"
  }
}
```

## Installation & Setup

1. Install the new dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

2. Patch the Flex interpreter according to the instructions in `backend/flex_patch.js`

3. Restart the server to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   pm2 restart ecosystem.config.js
   ```

## Usage Example

Here's a simple Flex program that uses the input functionality:

```
print("What is your name?")
name = da5l()
print("Hello, {name}!")

print("How old are you?")
age = da5l()
print("In 10 years, you will be {age + 10} years old!")
```

To run this program:

1. Paste the code into the editor
2. Click "Run" or press Ctrl+Enter
3. When prompted for input (status will change to "Waiting for input"), enter your name
4. When prompted again, enter your age
5. View the output with your personalized message

## Troubleshooting

- **WebSocket Connection Issues**: Check browser console for connection errors. The system will fall back to AJAX if WebSockets are not available.
- **Input Not Recognized**: Ensure the Flex interpreter has been patched correctly to emit the special token.
- **Program Hanging**: There is now a 30-second timeout (increased from 10 seconds) to accommodate input handling. If a program exceeds this time, it will be terminated.

## Future Improvements

- Add syntax highlighting for the da5l() function in the editor
- Implement a visual indicator in the code gutter when input is expected
- Add ability to save and load input sets for testing
- Create a step-by-step execution mode with input breakpoints
